# MATLAB GUI for Disease Modeling
This GUI was created in MATLAB for fun and to gain experience using GUIs and PDEs in MATLAB.

All files, including the images of countries, should be kept in the same folder.

The only file that is necessary to be opened, is the file called "Charles_Rabolli_Start.m"
Once that file is opened, click "Run" and the GUI should initialize.

If MATLAB declares that you must change your file folder, do so such that the current MATLAB folder is the one where you have saved all of the files
